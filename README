Hello there

This repository, as it's named contains solutions to a very few problems listed in the Project Euler.

Project Euler is basically a collection of hundreds of challenging mathematical and/or computer programming problems.

I solve them when I need to take a break and/or I'm bored.
It's pretty fun.

Most of my solutions are in Python, but they can really be done in any language, for some reason on GitHub it says JavaScript to be the dominant language used. Not exactly sure why, probably the big .csv file?

This repo doesn shoe a lot of commits from me, because for a while there my email id wasn't configured.

I haven't submitted a lot of solutions, because they take like forever to run, due to huge number of iterations or deep regressions. But I've tested most of the scripts for smaller values, and they work fine.

Cheers
