Hello there

This repository, as it's named contains solutions to a very few problems listed in the Project Euler.

Project Euler is basically a collection of hundreds of challenging mathematical and/or computer programming problems.

I solve them when I need to take a break and/or I'm bored.
It's pretty fun.

Most of my solutions are in Python, but they can really be done in any language, for some reason on GitHub it says JavaScript to be the dominant language used. Not exactly sure why, probably the big .csv file?

It doesn't show a lot of contributions becasue I didn't realise that one has to change their email address in the git config file on your system before commiting. So I committed a lot of things from a different email id, and it doesn't show in the contributions chart. Rest in Pepperoni for me.

I haven't submitted a lot of solutions, because they take like forever to run, due to huge number of iterations or deep regressions. But I've tested most of the scripts for smaller values, and they work fine.

Cheers

P.S.
I don't know who you are, but I hope you have a great day! c: :)

P.P.S.
I have some really embarrassing commit messages (and apparently README too), don't judge

P.P.P.S
I only try to solve these problems when I'm feeling down. So don't judge
